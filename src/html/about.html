    <h2>About</h2>

<p>The Heritage Business Unit at the City of Ballarat is in the process of transition, towards

broader, more proactive and holistic engagement approaches. In order to do this, members of

    the public must be able to influence planning decisions. </p>

    <p>TimeCapsule helps make this happen.</p>

<p>TimeCapsule is designed to work with existing '<a href="http://www.hulballarat.org.au/">Historic Urban Landscape</a>' initiatives of the City

of Ballarat, Federation University Australiaâ€™s Centre for e-Research and Digital Innovation

    (<a href="http://cerdi.edu.au">CERDI</a>) and Collaborative Research Centre in Australian History (<a href="http://federation.edu.au/research/research-areas/research-centres-and-networks/crcah">CRCAH</a>),
    the World Heritage

    Institute of Training and Research Asia-Pacific (<a href="http://historicurbanlandscape.com">WHITRAP</a>), and <a href="http://unesco.org">UNESCO</a>.</p>
